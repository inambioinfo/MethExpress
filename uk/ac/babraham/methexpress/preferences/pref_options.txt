 --minValue2		order for that line to be used for correlation [Default no filter]
 
 --minDiff1			What is the smallest absolute difference between the largest and smallest values
 --minDiff2			on a line in data file 1 or 2 to allow this line to be used for correlation [Default 0]

 --matchDist		What is the maximum distance between probes which still allows them to be validly
 					paired [Default 100,000]
 					
 --pValueFilter		What is the maximum pValue to be reported.  If multiple testing correction is applied
